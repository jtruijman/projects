# projects
An overview of projects I've worked on.

In this repository I've placed 3 of the projects I've worked on.

1. Sudoku solver
File: Sudoku.cs

This is a program that solves sudoku's.
It does this by applying guided random changes to the boxes and calculating scores for different instances of the board.

3. Reversi
File: Reversi.cs
This is a little game we had to program using Forms.

An interactive game of Reversi that adheres to the rules of the game. Can be played with 2 or 1.

5. N-gram based language detection
Files: langdetect.py, match_language.py, write_profiles.py, evaluate.py

This is a program that learns frequencies of N-grams in prelabled texts of different languages.
By calculating the occurrences of the N-gram in new texts, it can detect languages.
The accuracy differs by which type of N-gram is used. (mono-grams, bi-grams, tri-gram)
